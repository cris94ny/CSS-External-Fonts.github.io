 Google Fonts: Code Nation Fellowship
Code Nation needs your help to describe our Fellowship company partners. Pick a font to represent each company's brand.

**Mild**
Select the h1 tag in CSS and give it a font-family of "Helvetica". That is the Code Nation brand font! (You don't need Google fonts for this one.)

Select the Code Nation company partners by their class attributes and give each one a unique font. Go to Google Fonts for awesome font inspiration.

**Medium**
Add a class attribute to the h1 and p tags that describe Code Nation. Change the color to a Code Nation brand color (see lesson 3.3 for our hex color values).

Add a border to the image using Code Nation brand colors. (Hint: check the reference table if you get stuck)

**Spicy**
Add a :hover effect to the h2 tags See this W3 schools page for help with the :hover selector

  Use [Markdown](https://gist.github.com/cuonggt/9b7d08a597b167299f0d) to format your instructions.

  For example, here is a code block in python3
```python
def hello_world():
  print("hello world!")
```
